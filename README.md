This is a very simple Discord bot that accepts a phrase and looks through a server's entire message history to tally usages of that phrase. Results include total appearances along with a top 10 list of members who have used it the most often.

This bot currently has NO caching ability. Every search will cause the bot to brute force search the ENTIRE server message history! If your server is large and has a lot of visible history, this could take well over half an hour to fully search. Use at your own risk.
